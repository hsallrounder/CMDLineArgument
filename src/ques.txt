Q1) Write a program to create a class named shape. It should contain 2 methods, draw()
and erase() that prints “Drawing Shape” and “Erasing Shape” respectively.



Q2) Design a class that can be used by a health care professional to keep track of a patient’s vital statistics.
The following are the details.
Name of the class - Patient
Member Variables - patientName(String),height(double),width(double)
Member Function - double computeBMI()
The above method should compute the BMI and return the result.
The formula for computation of BMI  is weight (in kg) ÷ height*height(in metres).
Create an object of the Patient class and check the results.


Q3) Write a program to accept gender ("Male" or "Female") and age from command line arguments
and print the percentage of interest based on the given conditions.

If the gender is 'Female' and age is between 1 and 58, the percentage of interest is 8.2%.

If the gender is 'Female' and age is between 59 and 100, the percentage of interest is 9.2%.

If the gender is 'Male' and age is between 1 and 58, the percentage of interest is 8.4%.

If the gender is 'Male' and age is between 59 and 100, the percentage of interest is 10.5%.



Q4) Write a Program that accepts two Strings as command line arguments and generate the output in the required format.

Example1)
If the two command line arguments are GLA and Mathura then the output generated should be GLA University Mathura.

Example2)
If the command line arguments are AAA and Delhi then the output generated should be AAA Technologies Delhi

[Note: It is mandatory to pass two arguments in command line]





Q5) Write a Program to accept a String as a command line argument and print a Welcome message as given below.

Example1)
C:\> java Sample Aman
O/P Expected : Welcome Aman
Note: save this file with Sample.java



Q6) Write a Program to accept two integers as command line arguments and print the sum of the two numbers

Example1)
C:\>java filename 10 20
O/P Expected : The sum of 10 and 20 is 30


Q7) Write a program to check if the program has received command line arguments or not.

If the program has not received arguments then print "No Values",
else print all the values in a single line separated by ,(comma)

Example1) java Example
O/P: No values

Example2) java Example Mumbai Bangalore
O/P: Mumbai,Bangalore

[Hint: You can use length property of an array to check its length]




Q8) Write a program that finds the tens digit in a non-negative integer N (0 ≤ N ≤ 1000000).
Take a look at the examples:
If N is 264, the tens digit is 6.

If N is 4136, the tens digit is 3.

If N is 101, the tens digit is 0.
